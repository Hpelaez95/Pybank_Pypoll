# Pybank_Pypoll
Challenge Module 3 
For the challenges I placed the csvs needed in the same file for easier calling when looking for the file.
Worked with a tutor to grasp how to find the resuts in my pypoll data and how to be able to find the the percentages I need to verify each candidate.
helped me form my varible for the output and how to create my fstrings inside to be able to print them out in the terminal.
Creating the writerow and the new document was referenced from class to work properly.

For the pybank challenge the tutor also helped me define the lists and the empty variables I would need and also how to get the total count of a row.
from that she also helped me create the iteration for the loops and how they would reference both the leading and current row to create the change in profit.
And same thing as pypoll the printout and variable was referenced from the tutor assistance to be able to call it and use it multiple times as needed. 
creating a print out and a new document for the results.
